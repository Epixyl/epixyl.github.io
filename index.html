                <h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>Hi, I'm Jason! I'm a UCSD CSE Computer Engineering student, and this is my project I've been working on alongside my schoolwork! </p>
				<p>I love to code - my journey began with a simple drag-and-drop game design language back in junior high. My fascination with programming was born in that very summer camp. Coming from an environment where the answer to "Can I do that" was usually a resounding "no," I easily saw the possibilities programming provided. Ever since then, I have tinkered with programming everything from computer games to calculator programs to even this very website.</p>
				<p>What makes me who I am? I, and many of my peers, would easily say that it's that I can't resist a challenge. Whether it be a programming competition or a Rubik's cube (Both of which I love), I strive to succeed, putting in as much effort as I possibly can. I can't replicate the rewarding feeling of completing a program in any other way.</p>
				<p>Anyways, you're probably tired of reading by now. Below I have showcased some of the projects I've worked on, and if you have questions, comments, suggestions, or any other things to say, feel free to contact me through any of the means listed at the bottom of this website.</p>
				<p>Thanks for taking the time to explore!</p>

					<p><i>An educational puzzle game exploring turing machines.</i></p>
					<img src="http://i.imgur.com/w6pIZmJ.png" class="img-thumbnail">
					<br><br>
					<p>This was a Unity C# educational game I conceptualized way back in high school. It allows players to take simple tools and create a turing-machine-like being out of them using programming concepts and logic. With a gradual learning curve, playing the games has helped many of my friends, and thousands of other players, to learn the basics of programming in an interactive way. Special challenges that push the limits of turing machines also are provided for more experienced coders.
				    </p>
					<p>The game has many complex features that were fun to implement. Users are able to save and load their own levels to share and improve upon. This was done by serializing the game's state into a short string that could be copy and pasted with ease. Only the most necessary information was stored to save memory. Users are also pitted against each other in a game of efficiency by utilizing API's to keep track of a leaderboard. With this feature, players are inspired to iterate on their designs.</p>
                    <p>
                        However, the thing that sticks with me the most about this game was the panic and emotion that I felt when I released it. It was the first time I had released one of my creations to the general public, and I quickly became bogged down trying to achieve perfection. As I expected, the game had mixed reviews. Puzzle games tend to be that way, especially challenging ones without fancy graphics. But still, seeing the feedback and constantly updating and fixing imperfections was a valuable experience that revealed troublesome spots I would have never considered myself. For instance, people generally ignored the tutorial, attempted to "fake" their way through some challenges, and other common programmer's pitfalls.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the end, the game settled in around 3.5 stars out of 5. I was and am still very satisfied with how well the game turned out. I encourage you to try it out. I get no monetary benefit from people playing my game, but as a puzzle fanatic, I like the thought of providing a nice puzzle for someone to enjoy.

						<h3><a href="#" target="_blank" ><u>Capture</u></a></h3>
						<p><i>A social exploration game, with a health tracker!</i></p>

					</div>

					<p>Capture is a Node.js webapp that pits users against each other in a battle of dominance. Players can run around landmark buildings in UC San Diego to capture them for their team. As players play the game, various stats such as distance traveled and calories burned are tracked. Ideally, you'd play the game naturally as the day goes on by taking alternate paths from class to class, but players can also intentionally go for a run to score for their team.</p>
					<p>This webapp was a quarter-long project with a team of 2. We used MongoDB as a database to store user data, and Node.js as a frontend. jQuery and Handlebars are just a couple of tools we used to make the flow of the webapp as smooth as possible. We continually iterated on our design by applying needfinding and paper prototypes at the start, with heuristic evaluation and A/B testing, and Google Analytics later on. </p>

					<h3><a href="https://github.com/Epixyl/Flappy2048" target="_blank" ><u>Flappy 2048</u></a></h3>
					<p><i>A minigame combining the two famous games "Flappy Bird" and "2048".</i></p>
					<img src="http://i.imgur.com/4DkNZjC.png" class="img-thumbnail">
					<br><br>
					<p>This was a game I created on a whim in about 3-4 hours after a friend jokingly asked me what would happen if "Flappy Bird" and "2048" were combined together.
							In my interpretation, the bird becomes a chain of blocks representing the powers of two that combine together like the 2048 game. As you play, the chain
							becomes longer and longer, making it harder to weave between the gaps in the incoming walls, creating a difficulty curve innate in the design of the game.</p>

					<h3><a href="First.mp3" target="_blank" ><u>Music Composition</u></a></h3>
					<p><i>One sample of many songs I have composed.</i></p>
					</div>

					<p>I have played the flute for over 10 years now, and so music has always been a big part of my life. I began collecting little melodies that would pop up into my head
							starting from early high school. I did this by inputting the notes into a midi creator, and the results were not pretty. However, now that I have access to more
							sophisticated programs, I have begun translating those crude midi files into better sounding songs.</p>
					<p>The song shown above was made using FL Studio.</p>
