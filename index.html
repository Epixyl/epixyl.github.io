                <h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>Hi, I'm Jason! I'm a UCSD CSE Computer Engineering student, and this is my project I've been working on alongside my schoolwork! </p>
				<p>I love to code - my journey began with a simple drag-and-drop game design language back in junior high. My fascination with programming was born in that very summer camp. Coming from an environment where the answer to "Can I do that" was usually a resounding "no," I easily saw the possibilities programming provided. Ever since then, I have tinkered with programming everything from computer games to calculator programs to even this very website.</p>
				<p>What makes me who I am? I, and many of my peers, would easily say that it's that I can't resist a challenge. Whether it be a programming competition or a Rubik's cube (Both of which I love), I strive to succeed, putting in as much effort as I possibly can. I can't replicate the rewarding feeling of completing a program in any other way.</p>
				<p>Anyways, you're probably tired of reading by now. Below I have showcased some of the projects I've worked on, and if you have questions, comments, suggestions, or any other things to say, feel free to contact me through any of the means listed at the bottom of this website.</p>
				<p>Thanks for taking the time to explore!</p>

					<h3><a href="http://jasonwu.io/boxes" target="_blank" ><u>Boxes</u></a></h3>
					<p><i>A puzzle game about building machines.</i></p>
					<img src="http://i.imgur.com/w6pIZmJ.png" class="img-thumbnail">
					<br><br>
					<p>This was a game I created way back in high school. It utilized GML, a popular and powerful game design language built in to the Gamemaker engine. 
						   It was also my first game that featured a save and load functionality. This project took around 6 months to build and refine, since I had schoolwork to do
						   at the time as well.</p>
					<p>The goal of the game is to form a working machine out of smaller parts. Boxes are inputted into the machine, each with a numerical value, and your machine needs to sort and manipulate
							them to satisfy rules such as "Accept boxes divisible by 2" or "Take the square root". The game was very popular amongst my friends, some of which were new to programming and enjoyed the easier levels,
							as well as others who enjoyed the challenge of the more difficult levels.</p>
							
					<p>Now, I have ported the game to Unity along with an overhaul of the game engine. Now it runs faster and has no bugs that I know of. You can even try it out for yourself by clicking the link above. </p>

						<h3><a href="https://github.com/Epixyl/TrollQuest" target="_blank" ><u>Troll Quest</u></a></h3>
						<p><i>A platformer game inspired by the infamous "Cat Mario" game.</i></p>
						<img src="http://i.imgur.com/QGc3q3e.png" class="img-thumbnail">
						<br><br>
					</div>
					
					<p>This was one of the first games I completed before high school. It utilized GameMaker, a popular and powerful game design engine at the time. 
						   It was finished in under a couple of months, as the programming was not to challenging. Why I put it here is because it was the first game I was inspired to make after the basic tutorials on building a simple game.</p>
					<p>This platformer is not just any one; it's designed with various traps and tricks throughout. With just one level, it can't be too hard, right? People who have tried this game out would say otherwise.
							Troll Quest remains to be the most popular of my creations, since the game is so simple yet frustrating. Give it a whirl if you have an hour to spare!</p>

					<h3><a href="https://github.com/Epixyl/Flappy2048" target="_blank" ><u>Flappy 2048</u></a></h3>
					<p><i>A minigame combining the two famous games "Flappy Bird" and "2048".</i></p>
					<img src="http://i.imgur.com/4DkNZjC.png" class="img-thumbnail">
					<br><br>
					<p>This was a game I created on a whim in about 3-4 hours after a friend jokingly asked me what would happen if "Flappy Bird" and "2048" were combined together.
							In my interpretation, the bird becomes a chain of blocks representing the powers of two that combine together like the 2048 game. As you play, the chain
							becomes longer and longer, making it harder to weave between the gaps in the incoming walls, creating a difficulty curve innate in the design of the game.</p>

					<h3><a href="First.mp3" target="_blank" ><u>Music Composition</u></a></h3>
					<p><i>One sample of many songs I have composed.</i></p>
					</div>
					
					<p>I have played the flute for over 10 years now, and so music has always been a big part of my life. I began collecting little melodies that would pop up into my head
							starting from early high school. I did this by inputting the notes into a midi creator, and the results were not pretty. However, now that I have access to more
							sophisticated programs, I have begun translating those crude midi files into better sounding songs.</p>
					<p>The song shown above was made using FL Studio.</p>
