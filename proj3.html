					<h3><a href="http://jasonwu.io/boxes" target="_blank" ><u>Spotify Redesign</u></a></h3>
					<p><i>Reimagining music streaming services.</i></p>
					<img src="img/redesign.png" class="img-thumbnail"><img src="img/redesign2.png" class="img-thumbnail">
					<br><br>
					<p>This was a study to analyze the design of popular music streaming sites such as Spotify, Pandora, iTunes, Youtube, and more. In this project, two other teammates and I did thorough interviewing to learn about all the different ways people use these services. After several interviews, we gathered together several use cases for these applications. We then took a look at which music services made it easy for users to perform those use cases, and which could use improvement. We used several techniques to accomplish this, including creating a sitemap of each popular service and performing competitive analysis on the several competitors.
				    </p>
					<p>The results of this analysis were somewhat surprising. Every site we tried could not cater to all the use cases we found. Instead, each service seemed to specialize in a certain type of user. For instance, Spotify tries to make it easy for people to listen to music on the go, but their applications were hard to use if you were trying to study. Youtube makes it easy to create playlists and share them, but fails to provide a easy way to modify them.</p>
                    <p>After the analysis, we created a prototype for a different application, applying what we learned from our research. Our application was built off Spotify, since we found that it had the greatest functionality out of the options in terms of music playlist creation and use. We added features such as a large control panel at the bottom of the screen, convenient buttons when scrolling through playlists, large and colorful buttons for ease of use, and added different ways to play through a playlist. Some of these features came from other applications, such as the control panel. (Part of SoundCloud). </p>
                    <p>One of the challenges we faced was that it was hard to come up with use cases that could be applied to all of the music applications we were analyzing. Many of our interviewers used the music services for the same reason, so we had to find more people to interview to get a bigger view of what people use them for. </p>
